          <div class="story-content">
            <p>Some call him Pawo, some Par Desi.</p>
            <p>Rinchen la came to India from Tibet when he was just 8 years old, completely alone. He never saw his
              parents again. They passed away while he was still here, in exile, and he never got the chance to say
              goodbye. That loss has stayed with him quietly, over the years.</p>
            <p>He learned woodcraft at Norbulingka Institute — a skill he slowly mastered through dedication and hard
              work. But life outside the workshop was full of struggle. He was often taken advantage of, made to work by
              people he trusted, and left unpaid or unrecognized.</p>
            <p>In 1994, during a violent clash between locals and Tibetans, his workplace in lower Dharamsala was burned
              down. After that, he travelled across India, earning respect and recognition for his remarkable precision
              in Tibetan woodwork.</p>
            <p>But somewhere along the way, things got difficult. He slipped into alcohol addiction, and for a while,
              that became what people knew him for—not his craft, but his drinking. Some of his lowest moments were even
              shared online, turning real pain into something to laugh at.</p>
            <p>Eventually, he reached a turning point. It was not just one thing—it was many. Time spent in a
              rehabilitation centre gave him space to reflect and rebuild. Losing a close friend to alcohol added to the
              wake-up call. And little by little, Rinchen la made the choice to change. He left behind drinking
              completely — not a single sip since — and started over.</p>
            <p>Now in his late 40s, unmarried and living simply, Rinchen la runs Rinchen Wood Works at Norbulingka. He
              carves sacred Tibetan designs with meaning, intention, and spiritual precision. “Even a small change in a
              design,” he says, “can destroy its whole message.”</p>
            <p>He is not just creating beautiful pieces—he’s preserving the depth of Tibetan tradition. His vision is to
              ensure that this ancient craft is respected for what it truly is: full of purpose, prayer, and centuries
              of wisdom.</p>
            <p>With support from Tibet Fund through TibetStartup!, we are now helping him bring his work into the
              digital space—from branding and legal support to building a professional website and social media
              platforms.</p>
            <p>Rinchen la’s story is a reminder that healing takes time — and that no one is beyond repair. He fell,
              yes. But he also rose — through his craft, through his choices, and through the quiet power of starting
              again.</p>
